# Linked List Implementations in Java

This repository contains two different implementations of linked lists in Java:

1. **Singly Linked List**
2. **Circular Linked List**

Each implementation supports basic operations such as insertion, searching, deletion, and printing the list.

## Features

### 1. Singly Linked List

A Singly Linked List is a data structure where each node points to the next node in the sequence, and the last node points to `null`. It supports the following operations:

- **Insert**: Adds a new node with a given value to the end of the list.
- **Search**: Checks if a node with a given value exists in the list.
- **Delete**: Removes the node containing the given value.
- **Print List**: Displays all the elements in the list.

### 2. Circular Linked List

A Circular Linked List is similar to a Singly Linked List, except that the last node points back to the head, forming a circle. It supports the following operations:

- **Insert**: Adds a new node with a given value at the end of the list.
- **Search**: Finds whether a node with the given value exists in the list.
- **Delete**: Removes the node containing the given value.
- **Print List**: Displays all the elements in the list, starting from the head and circling back.
